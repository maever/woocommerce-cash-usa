# Create a Payment Gateway Plugin for¬†WooCommerce

Updated on February 21, 2024

I started this tutorial back there when [I¬†was visiting Stockholm](https://rudrastyh.com/journal/wordcamp-oslo-2018.html#stockholm) but I am always trying to keep it up to to date with the latest WooCommerce versions. As well as a lot of custom payments gateways have been developed for the clients by me and [my team](https://rudrastyh.com/about) since then and I am doing my best to reflect the gained experience in this guide.

Below you can find a super-detailed step by step for WooCommerce custom payment gateway development, so you can create your own.

On the other hand, if you face any difficulties in the process or you‚Äôre just looking for someone to develop a payment plugin for you, feel free to [contact us](https://rudrastyh.com/contact?subject=1).

## Step 1. We begin with creating a plugin¬†[](#gateway_plugin)

In case, you don‚Äôt know, custom payment methods are just plugins. So we have to create one.

When I first heard about plugins for WordPress I thought it is so hard to create one. But actually, to create a plugin you just need to create a file and add a couple lines of code inside it.

So, in the `/plugins` folder I created `misha-gateway.php` file and added the following code there. In case your plugin will have more than one file, place it in the folder with the same name, for example: `misha-gateway/misha-gateway.php`.

```php
<?php
/*
 * Plugin Name: WooCommerce Custom Payment Gateway
 * Plugin URI: https://rudrastyh.com/woocommerce/payment-gateway-plugin.html
 * Description: Take credit card payments on your store.
 * Author: Misha Rudrastyh
 * Author URI: http://rudrastyh.com
 * Version: 1.0.1
 */
```

Once you do it, the plugin will appear in your admin area! And you can even activate it.

![Custom payment gateway plugin for WooCommerce.](https://rudrastyh.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-custom-payment-plugin.png)

Add custom payment gateway in WooCommerce programmatically, first steps.

## Step 2. Payment Gateways are PHP classes that extend WC\_Payment\_Gateway, here is the class base¬†[](#gateway_class)

So, we have to create a custom PHP Class to extend the WooCommerce `WC_Payment_Gateway` class.

Every class method is described below. You can begin with copying and pasting the below code into your main plugin file.

```php
/*
 * This action hook registers our PHP class as a WooCommerce payment gateway
 */
add_filter( 'woocommerce_payment_gateways', 'misha_add_gateway_class' );
function misha_add_gateway_class( $gateways ) {
	$gateways[] = 'WC_Misha_Gateway'; // your class name is here
	return $gateways;
}

/*
 * The class itself, please note that it is inside plugins_loaded action hook
 */
add_action( 'plugins_loaded', 'misha_init_gateway_class' );
function misha_init_gateway_class() {

	class WC_Misha_Gateway extends WC_Payment_Gateway {

 		/**
 		 * Class constructor, more about it in Step 3
 		 */
 		public function __construct() {

		...

 		}

		/**
 		 * Plugin options, we deal with it in Step 3 too
 		 */
 		public function init_form_fields(){

		...
	
	 	}

		/**
		 * You will need it if you want your custom credit card form, Step 4 is about it
		 */
		public function payment_fields() {

		...
				 
		}

		/*
		 * Custom CSS and JS, in most cases required only when you decided to go with a custom credit card form
		 */
	 	public function payment_scripts() {

		...
	
	 	}

		/*
 		 * Fields validation, more in Step 5
		 */
		public function validate_fields() {

		...

		}

		/*
		 * We're processing the payments here, everything about it is in Step 5
		 */
		public function process_payment( $order_id ) {

		...
					
	 	}

		/*
		 * In case you need a webhook, like PayPal IPN etc
		 */
		public function webhook() {

		...
					
	 	}
 	}
}
```

If you inserted the code above ‚Äúas is‚Äù in your plugin file, you‚Äôd get a 500 error because this code just shows the plugin class structure, where each method should be.

## Step 3. Payment Gateway Plugin Options¬†[](#gateway_options)

In the class constructor we:

*   Define class properties, like gateway ID and name, lines 23-33,
*   Initialize the settings, lines 35-39,
*   Append options to class properties, lines 40-45,
*   Save options, line 48,
*   Enqueue custom JavaScript and CSS if needed, line 51.

We can also register payment gateway webhooks in the class constructor (example on line 54).

```php
public function __construct() {

	$this->id = 'misha'; // payment gateway plugin ID
	$this->icon = ''; // URL of the icon that will be displayed on checkout page near your gateway name
	$this->has_fields = true; // in case you need a custom credit card form
	$this->method_title = 'Misha Gateway';
	$this->method_description = 'Description of Misha payment gateway'; // will be displayed on the options page

	// gateways can support subscriptions, refunds, saved payment methods,
	// but in this tutorial we begin with simple payments
	$this->supports = array(
		'products'
	);

	// Method with all the options fields
	$this->init_form_fields();

	// Load the settings.
	$this->init_settings();
	$this->title = $this->get_option( 'title' );
	$this->description = $this->get_option( 'description' );
	$this->enabled = $this->get_option( 'enabled' );
	$this->testmode = 'yes' === $this->get_option( 'testmode' );
	$this->private_key = $this->testmode ? $this->get_option( 'test_private_key' ) : $this->get_option( 'private_key' );
	$this->publishable_key = $this->testmode ? $this->get_option( 'test_publishable_key' ) : $this->get_option( 'publishable_key' );

	// This action hook saves the settings
	add_action( 'woocommerce_update_options_payment_gateways_' . $this->id, array( $this, 'process_admin_options' ) );

	// We need custom JavaScript to obtain a token
	add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', array( $this, 'payment_scripts' ) );
	
	// You can also register a webhook here
	// add_action( 'woocommerce_api_{webhook name}', array( $this, 'webhook' ) );
 }
```

Depending on the payment processor you use, the option fields could be different, but in most cases you will have ‚ÄúEnabled/Disabled‚Äù, ‚ÄúTitle‚Äù, ‚ÄúDescription‚Äù and ‚ÄúTest mode‚Äù options.

```php
public function init_form_fields(){

	$this->form_fields = array(
		'enabled' => array(
			'title'       => 'Enable/Disable',
			'label'       => 'Enable Misha Gateway',
			'type'        => 'checkbox',
			'description' => '',
			'default'     => 'no'
		),
		'title' => array(
			'title'       => 'Title',
			'type'        => 'text',
			'description' => 'This controls the title which the user sees during checkout.',
			'default'     => 'Credit Card',
			'desc_tip'    => true,
		),
		'description' => array(
			'title'       => 'Description',
			'type'        => 'textarea',
			'description' => 'This controls the description which the user sees during checkout.',
			'default'     => 'Pay with your credit card via our super-cool payment gateway.',
		),
		'testmode' => array(
			'title'       => 'Test mode',
			'label'       => 'Enable Test Mode',
			'type'        => 'checkbox',
			'description' => 'Place the payment gateway in test mode using test API keys.',
			'default'     => 'yes',
			'desc_tip'    => true,
		),
		'test_publishable_key' => array(
			'title'       => 'Test Publishable Key',
			'type'        => 'text'
		),
		'test_private_key' => array(
			'title'       => 'Test Private Key',
			'type'        => 'password',
		),
		'publishable_key' => array(
			'title'       => 'Live Publishable Key',
			'type'        => 'text'
		),
		'private_key' => array(
			'title'       => 'Live Private Key',
			'type'        => 'password'
		)
	);
}
```

If you‚Äôve done everything correctly, your options page should look like this:

![WooCommerce custom payment gateway options.](https://rudrastyh.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/custom-payment-gateway-options.png)

Payment options of our custom gateway

If you need WooCommerce payment gateway development (integrating your payment processor API with WooCommerce), just [let us know](https://rudrastyh.com/contact), me and my team are here to help üôÇ

## Step 4. Direct Checkout Form¬†[](#gateway_form)

Before implementing the code below, please read these key points:

*   If you‚Äôre creating a payment gateway like PayPal, where all the user actions happen on the payment gateway website, you can skip this step, just do not add `payment_fields()` and `validate_fields()` methods and continue to [Step 5](#gateway_processing).
*   In this tutorial I assume that you use a payment processor that sends card data with its own AJAX request and gives you a token that you can use in PHP, so do not (!) add `name` attributes to the card form fields. This is how it works by step:
    1.  A customer fills in his card data and clicks the ‚ÄúPlace Order‚Äù button.
    2.  We delay the form submission using `checkout_place_order` event in WooCommerce and send an AJAX request with card data directly to our payment processor,
    3.  If customer details are OK, the processor returns a token, and we add it to our form below,
    4.  Now we can submit the form (in JS, of course),
    5.  We use the token in PHP to capture a payment via the payment processor‚Äôs API.

### 4.1 Enqueue scripts

In step 2 we‚Äôve already added `wp_enqueue_scripts` action hook and connect `payment_scripts()` method to it.

```php
public function payment_scripts() {

	// we need JavaScript to process a token only on cart/checkout pages, right?
	if( ! is_cart() && ! is_checkout() && ! isset( $_GET[ 'pay_for_order' ] ) ) {
		return;
	}

	// if our payment gateway is disabled, we do not have to enqueue JS too
	if( 'no' === $this->enabled ) {
		return;
	}

	// no reason to enqueue JavaScript if API keys are not set
	if( empty( $this->private_key ) || empty( $this->publishable_key ) ) {
		return;
	}

	// do not work with card detailes without SSL unless your website is in a test mode
	if( ! $this->testmode && ! is_ssl() ) {
		return;
	}

	// let's suppose it is our payment processor JavaScript that allows to obtain a token
	wp_enqueue_script( 'misha_js', 'some payment processor site/api/token.js' );

	// and this is our custom JS in your plugin directory that works with token.js
	wp_register_script( 'woocommerce_misha', plugins_url( 'misha.js', __FILE__ ), array( 'jquery', 'misha_js' ) );

	// in most payment processors you have to use PUBLIC KEY to obtain a token
	wp_localize_script( 'woocommerce_misha', 'misha_params', array(
		'publishableKey' => $this->publishable_key
	) );

	wp_enqueue_script( 'woocommerce_misha' );

}
```

### 4.2 Obtain a token in JavaScript

Before all, I want to say that for every payment processor this code could be different, but the main idea is the same. Here is the content for your `misha.js` file:

```js
const successCallback = function( data ) {

	const checkoutForm = $( 'form.woocommerce-checkout' )

	// add a token to our hidden input field
	// console.log(data) to find the token
	checkoutForm.find( '#misha_token' ).val( data.token )

	// deactivate the tokenRequest function event
	checkoutForm.off( 'checkout_place_order', tokenRequest )

	// submit the form now
	checkoutForm.submit()

}

const errorCallback = function( data ) {
    console.log( data )
}

const tokenRequest = function() {

	// here will be a payment gateway function that process all the card data from your form,
	// maybe it will need your Publishable API key which is misha_params.publishableKey
	// and fires successCallback() on success and errorCallback on failure
	return false
		
}

jQuery( function( $ ){

	const checkoutForm = $( 'form.woocommerce-checkout' )
	checkoutForm.on( 'checkout_place_order', tokenRequest )

})
```

### 4.3 Form with card data

With `payment_fields()` class method you can create a payment form with card fields like this:

![WooCommerce form to process card data.](https://rudrastyh.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/woocommerce-card-form.png)

Below is the code:

```php
public function payment_fields() {
 
	// ok, let's display some description before the payment form
	if( $this->description ) {
		// you can instructions for test mode, I mean test card numbers etc.
		if( $this->testmode ) {
			$this->description .= ' TEST MODE ENABLED. In test mode, you can use the card numbers listed in <a href="#">documentation</a>.';
			$this->description  = trim( $this->description );
		}
		// display the description with <p> tags etc.
		echo wpautop( wp_kses_post( $this->description ) );
	}
 
	// I will echo() the form, but you can close PHP tags and print it directly in HTML
	echo '<fieldset id="wc-' . esc_attr( $this->id ) . '-cc-form" class="wc-credit-card-form wc-payment-form" style="background:transparent;">';
 
	// Add this action hook if you want your custom payment gateway to support it
	do_action( 'woocommerce_credit_card_form_start', $this->id );
 
	// I recommend to use inique IDs, because other gateways could already use #ccNo, #expdate, #cvc
	echo '<div class="form-row form-row-wide"><label>Card Number <span class="required">*</span></label>
		<input id="misha_ccNo" type="text" autocomplete="off">
		</div>
		<div class="form-row form-row-first">
			<label>Expiry Date <span class="required">*</span></label>
			<input id="misha_expdate" type="text" autocomplete="off" placeholder="MM / YY">
		</div>
		<div class="form-row form-row-last">
			<label>Card Code (CVC) <span class="required">*</span></label>
			<input id="misha_cvv" type="password" autocomplete="off" placeholder="CVC">
		</div>
		<div class="clear"></div>';
 
	do_action( 'woocommerce_credit_card_form_end', $this->id );
 
	echo '<div class="clear"></div></fieldset>';
 
}
```

## Step 5. Process payments¬†[](#gateway_processing)

### 5.1 Validate fields

I know that checkout fields like First name [should be validated earlier](https://rudrastyh.com/woocommerce/checkout-fields.html), but this is just an¬†example:

```php
public function validate_fields(){
 
	if( empty( $_POST[ 'billing_first_name' ] ) ) {
		wc_add_notice( 'First name is required!', 'error' );
		return false;
	}
	return true;
 
}
```

### 5.2 Capture payments with API and set the order status

Prepare for a lot of text üôÉ

*   Once you get the order object with `wc_get_order()` function, you can use its methods like `get_billing_first_name()`, `get_billing_country()`, `get_billing_address_1()` etc. to get the customer billing and shipping details (by the way, you can find all the methods in `includes/class-wc-order.php` which is in WooCommerce plugin folder). You can also get the billing details from `$_POST` array, at the moment of writing this tutorial, I‚Äôm not sure which way is better.
*   You can add notes to the order with `$order->add_order_note()` method, it can be notes to a customer (will be displayed in the member‚Äôs area) and private notes (only on edit order pages).  
    Order notes on Edit Order pages
*   In this tutorial we consider using direct payments without going to gateway websites. But if for your purposes customers must go to a payment gateway website to complete their payment, you have to skip Step 4, and in this step, instead of capturing the payments with `wp_remote_post()`, use `add_query_arg()` to build a correct redirect URL to your payment gateway checkout page.
*   Use `$order->get_total()` to receive the order amount.
*   `get_woocommerce_currency()` should help you get the current shop currency.
*   If your payment gateway asks to list all the products in an order, use `$order->get_items()`, some examples you can [find here](https://rudrastyh.com/woocommerce/order-items.html#order_items_get).

```php
public function process_payment( $order_id ) {
 
	// we need it to get any order detailes
	$order = wc_get_order( $order_id );
 
 
	/*
 	 * Array with parameters for API interaction
	 */
	$args = array(
 
		...
 
	);
 
	/*
	 * Your API integration can be built with wp_remote_post()
 	 */
	 $response = wp_remote_post( '{payment processor endpoint}', $args );
 

	 if( 200 === wp_remote_retrieve_response_code( $response ) ) {
 
		 $body = json_decode( wp_remote_retrieve_body( $response ), true );
 
		 // it could be different depending on your payment processor
		 if( 'APPROVED' === $body[ 'response' ][ 'responseCode' ] ) {
 
			// we received the payment
			$order->payment_complete();
			$order->reduce_order_stock();
 
			// some notes to customer (replace true with false to make it private)
			$order->add_order_note( 'Hey, your order is paid! Thank you!', true );
 
			// Empty cart
			WC()->cart->empty_cart();
 
			// Redirect to the thank you page
			return array(
				'result' => 'success',
				'redirect' => $this->get_return_url( $order ),
			);
 
		 } else {
			wc_add_notice( 'Please try again.', 'error' );
			return;
		}
 
	} else {
		wc_add_notice( 'Connection error.', 'error' );
		return;
	}
 
}
```

### 5.3 In case you need a Payment Gateway Callback (Instant Payment Notifications, Webhooks, etc.)

Let‚Äôs say that our custom payment gateway doesn‚Äôt have its own form for the card data, and once the customer completed his billing details (like name, address etc) he will be redirected to a payment gateway website.

How can we check if payment is completed and display it in our store?

Manually? Huh, serious? üòê

Many payment gateways have payment notifications and this is how it works ‚Äî once a customer completed an order on a payment gateway website, the gateway sends a request with $\_GET parameters to a specific URL of our website that we set on the gateway‚Äôs settings page. And WooCommerce allows to process these requests.

The webhook URLs (callback URLs) in Woo look like this: `http://rudrastyh.com/wc-api/{webhook name}/`, the hook name could be near anything, for example, `paypal-payment-complete` or just `misha`. It absolutely doesn‚Äôt mean what you will use here, the main requirement is that {webhook name} in the URL and {webhook name} in the filter ([Step 3](#gateway_options), line 54) must match.

```php
add_action( 'woocommerce_api_{webhook name}', array( $this, 'webhook' ) );
```

And `webhook()` is the function (class method) that can do anything with `$_GET` parameters received.

```php
public function webhook() {
	
	$order = wc_get_order( $_GET[ 'id' ] );
	$order->payment_complete();
	$order->reduce_order_stock();

	update_option( 'webhook_debug', $_GET );
}
```

You do not have to add `exit;` at the end because it exits WordPress anyway once the code inside it is fired.
